			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>
				Regular Expressions (also known as "regex" and "regexp") are sequences of characters used to match character combinations in strings. Regex itself is a string made from certain rules that can represent a single string or a set of many other strings. Any string that satisfies the conditions set by the regex string is said to "match" it. It is really interesting, especially for those who love encoding and decoding things.

				<h3>Uses:</h3>
				<p>
					Now the question is, why is it necessary? Or, how is it related to programming?<br>Well, regex is generally used to find a string that "matches" the regular expression and perform the necessary actions that are needed. Hence, they are used by search engines, replace dialogs of word processors and text editors, etc.
				</p>
				<p>
					Programming languages either have regex as a built-in feature (like Javascript) or need to import regex as a library (like Python).
				</p>
			</p>

			<h2>Construction of Regular Expressions</h2>
			<p>As stated earlier, regex is made from certain rules to represent other strings. Thus, the first step is to know and understand the various special components or characters for representating regular expressions.</p>

			<h3>Special Characters/ Operations:</h3>
			<p>
				The special characters or operations are used to construct regex in a concised manner and to make it represent a larger group of strings. These include:

				<ol>
					<li>
						<h4>Boolean "or" ('|'):</h4>
						<p>
							A string satisfying any one of the expressions on either side of the 'or' operator is said to match the regex.

							<h6>Example:</h6> 'grey' and 'gray' both match <i>'grey|gray'</i>.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Groupings:</h4>
						<p>
							Groupings are used to group characters in order to define scope and precedence of operators or represent a particular set of characters at once. They are of variosu types but the two most important/used types are:

							<ul>
								<li>
									<h5>Parenthesis ('(...)'):</h5>
									They are used to define scope and precedence of operators.
									<br>
									<h6>Example:</h6> <i>'grey|gray'</i> can also be written as <i>'gr(e|a)y'</i>.
								</li>
								<li>
									<h5>Sqaure brackets ('[...]'):</h5>
									They are used to represent a set of characters.
									<br>
									<h6>Examples:</h6>
									<br>
									1. <i>'grey|gray'</i> can also be written as <i>'gr[a, e]y'</i>.
									<br>
									2. <i>'person[1-9]'</i> matches with 'person1', 'person2', and so on upto 'person9'.
									<br>
									<h6>NOTE:</h6> [^...] matches the strings that do NOT contain the characters in the square brackets at the given place.
									<br>
									<h6>Example:</h6> <i>'person[1-9]'</i> matches with 'person0', 'personx', etc. but NOT with person1, person2, and so on till person 9.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Wildcard ('.'):</h4>
						<p>
							This is a special character that is really special as it can refer to anything. It can match with any alphabet, number, or symbol.
							<h6>Example:</h6> <i>'gr.y'</i> can match with 'grey', 'grby', 'gr5y', 'gr$y' etc.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Quantifiers:</h4>
						<p>
							As the name suggests, quantifiers are used to "quantify" something and in this case, they are used to quantify characters. There are a number of quantifiers used for various purposes such as:

							<ul>
								<li>
									<h5>'?'' :</h5> Represents zero or one occurences of preceding character.
									<br>
									<h6>Example:</h6> <i>'he?y'</i> matches both 'hy' (zero occurrences of 'e' (character preceding '?')) and 'hey' (one occurrence of 'e') but not 'heey' (more than one occurrences of 'e').
								</li>
								<li>
									<h5>'*' :</h5> Represents zero or more occurrences of preceding character.
									<br>
									<h6>Example:</h6> <i>'hel?o'</i> matches 'heo', 'helo', 'hello', 'helllo', etc.
								</li>
								<li>
									<h5>'+' :</h5> Represents one or more occurrences of preceding character.
									<br>
									<h6>Example:</h6> <i>'hel?o'</i> matches 'helo', 'hello', 'helllo', etc. but not 'heo'.
								</li>
								<li>
									<h5>{ n } :</h5> Represents exactly 'n' occurrences of preceding character.
									<br>
									<h6>Example:</h6> <i>'hel{2}o'</i> matches only 'hello'.
								</li>
								<li>
									<h5>{min, } :</h5> Represents atleast 'min' number of occurrences of preceding character.
									<br>
									<h6>Example:</h6> <i>'hel{1, }o'</i> matches 'helo', 'hello', 'hellllo', etc.
								</li>
								<li>
									<h5>{min, max}</h5> Represents atleast 'min' and atmost 'max' number of occurrences of preceding character.
									<br>
									<h6>Example:</h6> <i>'hel{1, 2}o'</i> matches only 'helo' and hello'.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<h4>Escape Characters:</h4>
						<p>
							Now that we know about the work of operators like '*', '+', etc., the question which arises is: <em>What if we want to search for strings containing those special characters?</em> Obviously, the compiler will treat them as operators and assign them their jobs instead of treating them as characters required in searching. This is where escape characters make their heroic entrance.
						</p>

						<p>
							In order to use the special characters, the character are preceded by a backslash ('\').
							<br>
							<h6>Example:</h6> <i>'hi\*there'</i> represents 'hi*there'.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ol>

			<h2>Regex in Python</h2>
			<p>As stated above, some programming languages need to import regex as a library and as a matter of fact, Python is one of them. In Python, we import it using the <code id="program" class="language-python">import re</code> code. Perhaps, the most important use of <code id="program" class="language-python">re library</code> is the extraction of data. Now, as we learn the proper way for extracting data, we will encounter many functions, and they are listen below:</p>

			<h3>re.search() :</h3>
			<p>This function is like the <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/string_find.htm"><code id="program" class="language-python">find()</code></a> function in Python. It returns a <em>boolean</em> value (True if the substring being searched is present, and false otherwise).</p>

			<h5>Example 1: Using regex as parameter:</h5>
				<pre>
					<code id="program" class="language-python">
						import re

						paragraph = ["Hello!", "Welcome to Technizz", "Nice to meet you"]

						for line in paragraph:
							#If line starts from 'N':
							if re.search('^Nice', line):
								print(line)
							if re.search('^Technizz', line):
								print(line)
					</code>
				</pre>

				Output:
				<pre>
					<code id="program" class="language-python">
						Nice to meet you

						#Doesn't print the second line as it doesn't start from 'T'.
					</code>
				</pre>

			<h5>Example 2: Without regex as parameter:</h5>
			<h6>Note:</h6> This program is to show the resemblance of the function with <code id="program" class="language-python">find()</code> function.

				<pre>
					<code id="program" class="language-python">
						import re

						paragraph = ["Hello!", "Welcome to Technizz", "Nice to meet you"]

						for line in paragraph:
							#If line starts from 'N':
							if re.search('Technizz', line):
								print(line)
					</code>
				</pre>

				Output:
				<pre>
					<code id="program" class="language-python">
						#This line contains the word "Technizz" and hence is printed.
						Welcome to Technizz
					</code>
				</pre>

			<h3>re.findall():</h3>
			This function finds all the different occurrences of the substrings that match the regex and returns a <em>list</em>.

				<pre>
					<code id="program" class="language-python">
						import re

						line = "There are 12 months and 365/366 days in 1 year."

						#Find the substring which contains ATLEAST one digit from 0 to 9.
						y = re.findall("[0-9]+", line)						
						print(y)
					</code>
				</pre>

				Output:
				<pre>
					<code id="program" class="language-python">
						#Prints only the numbers and NOT the characters (here '/') surrounding them.
						['12', '365', '366', '1']
					</code>
				</pre>

				<h4>!!! Greedy Matching:</h4>
				<p>Those exclamation marks show how important this is as not considering this topic while writing a program can bring unwanted results.</p>
				<p>Though from the above example, <code id="program" class="language-python">re.findall()</code> may seem to be 'precise' on what it includes in the list, it isn't. Let's consider the following example:</p>

				<pre>
					<code id="program" class="language-python">
						import re

						line1 = "Welcome to: Technizz: Nice to meet you"

						y = re.findall("^W.+:", line1)
						print(y)
					</code>
				</pre>

				Output:
				<pre>
					<code id="program" class="language-python">
						#Expected :- "Welcome to:" ; the output received:-
						['Welcome to: Technizz:']
					</code>
				</pre>

			<p>Though we would generally expect it to stop searching after the condition of regex is satisfied for the first time, it does not. It expands it's search in the forward (as in this case) and in the backward (if possible) directions and finds the <em>largest possible match</em> (maybe it simply wants to prove it's dedication and hard-work).</p>

			<h5>Converting it to "not-greedy":</h5>
			<p>This is done using the '?' symbol in the following way:</p>

				<pre>
					<code id="program" class="language-python">
						import re

						line1 = "Welcome to: Technizz: Nice to meet you"

						y = re.findall("^W.+?:", line1)
						print(y)
					</code>
				</pre>

				Output:
				<pre>
					<code id="program" class="language-python">
						#Stops after the after finding the first match.
						['Welcome to:']
					</code>
				</pre>
